PROJECT: CAC & LTV MODEL
===========================================================

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

This project models Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), Lifetime Value (LTV), and retention dynamics for a fictional SaaS business operating in six global regions. Using synthetic data, it simulates key subscription business metrics to assess profitability and customer behavior across marketing channels and geographic segments.

KEY FINDINGS:

- Average CAC ranges from ~$50 to ~$400 depending on acquisition channel, with organic search proving significantly cheaper.
- Average LTV across all customers is ~$4,290.
- LTV:CAC ratios are highest for organic search (86.9x) and lowest for Google Ads (10.5x).
- Organic Search has the highest LTV:CAC ratio (~87x), driven by low CAC and solid retention.
- Paid channels like Google Ads and Meta Ads yield decent LTV but higher acquisition costs.
- ARPU varies moderately across regions, ranging from ~$163 in the Middle East to ~$176 in LatAm.
- Cohorts show typical churn over the first 12 months, with retention stabilizing around ~50% thereafter. This is visualized via cohort heatmaps.

RECOMMENDATIONS:

- Shift budget away from higher-CAC channels toward organic and lower-cost acquisition strategies.
- Explore longer contract lengths to stabilize churn rates.
- Further segment marketing efforts by region, given ARPU differences.

Note:
This is a synthetic dataset. CAC values are likely lower than real-world SaaS benchmarks because marketing spend was randomized in a narrow range. In practice, CAC can vary significantly and may be 3-10x higher depending on industry, region, and product type.

This analysis provides actionable insights to maximize customer value while reducing acquisition costs, improving strategic decision-making for growth and profitability.
